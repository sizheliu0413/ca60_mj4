        I imagined the future from myself, my imagination began with my appearance and then goes to the change in physical ways, such as where I am going in several years. Also, based on my most fancy imagination, I put myself in a state where it is unlikely to be real but I want it to happen. After taking a rest for a while, I had a concrete idea and started to create works. In the process of creation, I forced myself to put myself into the future world, whether real or virtual. I found that I would know myself better and know what I want in the future through this project. After these works are completed, I find that we will look forward to the future of our own future, and will first imagine the small aspects, and then think of the big aspects: affecting themselves or the people around them.</p>
